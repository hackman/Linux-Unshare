Linux-Unshare
=============

  Linux::Unshare - Perl interface for Linux unshare system call.

This trivial module provides an interface to the Linux unshare system call. It
also provides the CLONE_* constants that are used to specify which kind of
unsharing must be performed. Note that some of these are still not implemented
in the Linux kernel, and others are still experimental.

The unshare system call allows a process to 'unshare' part of the process
context which was originally shared using clone(2).

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module does not require any 3rd party libraries, but the build does require
your machine to have the <sched.h> header file. It also requires a fairly recent
kernel to work.
